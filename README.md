Things i learned/struggled with:

Making a reusable function that takes in state thats stored as an object and is able to change the values of the state. I made a function solely for the spreading of teh state, and left all parameters generic, made another function while passing in the arguments i needed (i kept these vague as well)
and when i called the function as a prop, i then passed in the arguments i needed for specific values. This created me a highly reusable function that follows a method statement.



Making a highly dynamic fetch call with axios.

Getting familiar with the While loop so we can display all returned items from every page of the api call.
