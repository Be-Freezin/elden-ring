# elden-ring

A tool to help the user plan out there build for the game Elden Ring. Elden Ring is a game from the company FromSoftware, they are world renowned for there challenging games such as Dark Souls (1, 2 and 3), Bloodborne, and most recently Elden Ring. I wanted to create a way for someone to plan out there build for there gaming experience. I utilized an open source API dedicated to the game and all data is coming from the API. There are some things missing from this API, but i wanted to use it anyways and do with it what i can. I will continue to develop this site as i grow more as a developer and work on the complex calculations that these games tend to have.
Making the site pretty wasn't the the focus of this project, the focus was purely on the technical side of react and javascript.

## Techstack

* **ReactJS**
  * I wanted to use react for this project because i want to increase my proficiency and skill with react. This project has increased my knowledge and confidence in react and im excited to keep using react for future projects.
* **TailwindCSS**
  * Tailwind is a efficient way to make great, responsive layouts. I still feel like im not using tailwind to its fullest potential but that will all come in time. 
* **DaisyUI**
  * With styling not my main focus on this project, i wanted something i could use to make it look presentable with minimal effort. DaisyUI has been great at that. It works extremely well with tailwind and it is easily customizable.   

## Challenges/Things I learned

This project was a bit more then i could handle at times, but I wanted to push through and use this as a great learning experience.

Some key things I learned through out this project were:

Making a reusable function that takes in state thats stored as an object and is able to change the values of the state. I made a function solely for the spreading of the state, and left all parameters generic, made another function while passing in the arguments i needed (i kept these vague as well)
and when i called the function as a prop, i then passed in the arguments i needed for specific values. This created me a highly reusable function that follows a method statement.

Making a highly dynamic fetch call with axios.

Getting familiar with the While loop so we can display all returned items from every page of the api call.

Increasing my comfort levels with API calls and displaying the data returned by it.
